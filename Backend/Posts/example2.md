## Student during the day.
# Programmer during the night.

My name is Oz Tamir and I am a self-taught programmer as well as a high school student.

I also take classes in Computer Science as a student in Tel-Aviv University, part of the *"Future Scientists and Inventors"* program's Cyber track, offered to high school students who wish to learn computer science at a higher level.

In my free time I like to hack on cool and fun projects and learn more about the world of computers, programming and cyber technology.
