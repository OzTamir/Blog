                            My name is Oz Tamir and I am a self-taught programmer as well as a high school student.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also take classes in Computer Science as a student in Tel-Aviv University, part of the "Future Scientists and Inventors"
                            program's Cyber track, offered to high school students who wish to learn computer science at a higher level.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time I like to hack on cool and fun projects and learn more about the world of computers, programming and cyber technology.
